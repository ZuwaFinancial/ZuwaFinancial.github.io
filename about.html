            <p>
            I am Richard Osazuwa Omobogie, CFP®, CRPC, and I started Zuwa Financial LLC, a fee-only financial planning and registered investment advisory firm to help Professionals, families and small business owners bring their diverse financial goals within reach.

</p>

<p>
Although currently residing in Dallas, Texas, I came with humble beginnings from Nigeria in 2007.

<p>
The name of the firm “Zuwa” means "Chosen to provide wealth and prosperity." I take the firm's name seriously and am fully committed to its true meaning by being a veritable resource.

</p>

<p>
Over the years, I have been honored and privileged to work with a wide variety of clients, from young individuals wanting a ‘smart start’, to multi-generational high net worth individuals and families. These experiences have shown me that personal  financial planning and investment management can be very complex, but the process doesn’t have to be intimidating or overwhelming to any.

</p>

<p>
While my professional life is solely focused on financial planning and investment management, I believe it’s all about a lot more than just the dollars and cents!  I believe that we need to be good stewards of the resources we have and we will be able to achieve more for ourselves and for others if we are thoughtful and well prepared for the future.

</p>

<p>
Having a solid financial plan is about giving you the peace of mind to enjoy all the things that are important to you.

<p>
By de-coupling professional advice from product sales, we can work together on what is most important to you without potential conflicts of interest or undue focus on different financial products. In my spare time, I enjoy playing badminton, working out at the gym, and engaging a personal worship sessions.

<p>
My background experience with companies such as Ameriprise Financial, VALIC Financial Advisors, Wells Fargo Advisors, LPL Financial and TIAA has provided me with a wide range of experience in financial services.
</p>
<p>
As a fee-only financial Advisor, I will be solely focused on financial planning and investment management, without sale of financial products.
</p>
<p>
I pride myself on being a joyful and energetic part of the community, haven worked with several professional associations and ethnic organizations to increase financial literacy in the Dallas community.
</p>
<p>
Although Nigerian by birth, I currently reside in Dallas, TX.
