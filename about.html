          <p>
          I am Richard Omobogie and I am the founder and CEO of Zuwa Financial LLC, an independent financial advisory practice.
          </p>

          <p>
          My background with companies such as Ameriprise Financial 
          and Wells Fargo Advisors has provided me with a wide range of experience in the field.
          </p>


          <p>
          My firm provides fee-only financial planning and investment management services.
          </p>

          <p>
          As a fee-only financial planner, I have no sales goals to meet, unlike traditional financial advisors.

          <br />
          This allows my to take a "zero sales" approach when offering my financial consulting services.
          <br />

          Instead, I can focus on the areas I am most passionate about: planning and 
          advice for individuals and families--regardless of their wealth 
          or circumstances.
          </p>

          <p> 
          I pride myself on being a joyful and energetic part of the community.
          I work with various professional associations and ethnic organizations to speak raise awareness about financial literacy.  
          </p>

          <p>
          I am originally from Nigeria but currently lives with his wife and 3 daughters in Dallas, Texas.
