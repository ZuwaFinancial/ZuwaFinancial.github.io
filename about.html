					The name of the firm “Zuwa” means "Chosen to provide wealth and prosperity." I take the firm's name seriously and am fully committed to its true meaning.
					</p>

					<p>
					Over the years, I have been honored and privileged to work with a wide variety of clients, from young individuals wanting a ‘smart start’, to multi-generational high net worth individuals and families. These experiences have shown me that personal financial planning and investment management can be very complex, but the process doesn’t have to be intimidating or overwhelming to any.
					</p>

					<p>
					Having a solid financial plan is about giving you the peace of mind to enjoy all the things that are important to you.
					</p>
					<p>

					I pride myself on being a joyful and energetic part of the community, and have worked with several professional associations and ethnic organizations to increase financial literacy in the Dallas community.

					</p>
					<p>
					One of the most important things to me has always been creating ways to invest time that builds relationship and trust with clients.
					</p>
					<p>
					In addition to being a financial expert among family and close friends, I have always positioned myself as a resource on several issues, ranging from mindfulness to inspirational motivation, connecting folks with the realities of today with their ever evolving defined future goals.

					</p>
					<p>
					In my spare time, I enjoy playing reading, playing badminton, working out at the gym, and engaging a personal worship sessions.
