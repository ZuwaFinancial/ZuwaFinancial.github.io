			<div class="question">
				<p>
				Why work with a CFP®?
				</p>
			</div> <!-- /question -->

			<div class="answer">
				<p>
        It’s simple. Financial planners with their CFP® certification are held to a high standard than any other advisor who is not certified. There are four pillars (Education, Examination, Experience, and Ethics) that a planner must satisfy before he/she is allowed to become a CFP®. Simply put, CFP® professionals have the expertise to develop a financial plan for you and are held to a fiduciary standard of care to act in your best interest at all times.

			<div class="question">
				<p>
				Can’t I just use resources found on the internet to do financial planning on my own?
				</p>
			</div> <!-- /question -->

			<div class="answer">
				<p>
				Yes, it’s possible, however it can be time consuming and it’s hard to know if you are doing things right. Errors can be costly to reverse and it is often cheaper to hire a professional to do it correctly and efficiently the first time. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Keep in mind the number of years of schooling, on-the-job experience, and continuing education that goes into becoming a financial planner. 
				</p>
				<p>
				It can be challenging for the average person to keep up with yearly tax code updates and changes as well as other financial innovations that affect your finances. 
				</p>
				<p>
				At the very least, a Do-It-Yourselfer should work with a financial planner to develop a customized financial plan that he/she can implement solo.

			<div class="question">
				<p>
				How do you approach working with clients?
				</p>
			</div> <!-- /question -->

			<div class="answer">
				<p>
				We all have different personal goals and therefore should have a customized financial plan that allows us to live our desired life. 
				</p>

				<p>
				No two financial plans should be exactly the same. We will start by learning as much about your current situation, goals, and aspirations. 
				</p>

				<p>
				The goal is to customize the ways of working together to what is most suitable for you. Some people prefer to work completely virtually while some really want the in-person interaction. 
				</p>

				<p>
				During our initial consultation and throughout, we will work together to fine-tune the best approach that is most suitable for you.

				</p>
			</div> <!-- /question -->
